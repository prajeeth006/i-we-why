## Documentation

This component allows you to compare two different font families side-by-side. You can select each font family and, 
if needed, overlay one font on top of the other to visually inspect their differences.

## Configurations:

For a basic comparison, select different font families for Font Family 1 and Font Family 2 with Overlap off.
Enable Overlap to observe subtle differences in line height, width, and baseline positioning.

Entain Design System buttons are native `<button>` or `<a>` elements enhanced with Entain Design System styling.

Native `<button>` and `<a>` elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward and accessible experience for users.
A `<button>` element should be used whenever some action is performed. An `<a>` element should be used whenever the user will <i>navigate</i> to another view.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.LeftIcon} />

## Usage

Import `DsButton` in your component, and apply `ds-button` in your buttons or anchor elements.

```ts
import { DsButton } from '@frontend/ui/button'; // ðŸ‘ˆ add to file imports

@Component({
    imports: [DsButton], // ðŸ‘ˆ add to component imports
    template: `...`,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

Text in between the Button will be rendered as label

```html
<button ds-button>The perfect button</button> <a ds-button routerLink="login">Login</a>
```

### Theming

Buttons can be colored in terms of the current theme that is applied. You can change the color by setting the `kind` input to one of these values:

-   primary (default)
-   secondary
-   tertiary
-   success
-   utility

### Size

DsButton offers 3 sizes, that you can apply using the `size` input:

-   small
-   medium
-   large (default)

### Variants

DsButton offers 3 variants, that you can apply using the `variant` input:

-   filled (default)
-   outline
-   flat

### Inverse buttons

There are cases when you would want to show inverse colors for your buttons, for example showing them in a different background than the one where it's supposed to be.

### Ripple Effect

Buttons can be enhanced with a ripple effect to provide visual feedback when they are clicked. This effect adds a dynamic visual cue, improving the overall user experience.

To apply a ripple effect to a button, simply use `dsRipple` directive as described in the [Ripple documentation](/docs/components-ripple--overview). The directive can be applied directly to the button element:

For more details on customizing the ripple effect, such as changing its color, opacity, or duration, refer to the [Ripple documentation](/docs/components-ripple--overview).

### Loading button

In order to show a loading spinner in the button, add an input of `loading="true"`.

If you want to show a different loading spinner or text instead of the default one, you can provide an `ng-template` with
`loadingTemplate` reference which will be shown inside the button.

> NOTE: the `loading` input should also be set to `true`

### Truncating

In order to truncate text inside some button, you can apply the input truncate as true to the button.

### Wrap the text in the button

In order to wrap text inside button, ou can use wrapText input to the button

### Disabled buttons

In order to disable the button, set the `disabled` property to `true`.

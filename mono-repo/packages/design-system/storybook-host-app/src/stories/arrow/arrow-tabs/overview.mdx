The arrow component is to show left and right arrows in the carousel manner components. These arrows are commonly used in web interfaces to display a series of images, content, or other elements in a sliding format. The right and left arrows are integral parts of the Carousel, allowing users to navigate through the carousel items.

<Canvas of={ArrowStories.Default} />

## Usage

Import `DsArrow` in your component.

```ts
import { DsArrow } from '@frontend/ui/arrow'; // ðŸ‘ˆ add to file imports

@Component({
    imports: [DsArrow], // ðŸ‘ˆ add to component imports
    template: `...`,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

You can implement and customize these arrows by using `ds-arrow` selector.
It provides default arrow from DS. Also you can pass `size`, `direction` and `inverse`values as input.

### Left Arrow

The left arrow is a navigational control that allows users to move to the previous item in the carousel.

### Right Arrow

The right arrow is a navigational control that allows users to move to the next item in the carousel.

### With Custom Icon

You can place your own icon inside the arrow component by using `<ng-template>`. Inside the `<ng-template>` you can place right or left svg icons

### Inputs

-   direction: left (default), right
-   size: small, medium, large
-   variant: strong, subtle
-   inverse: It will render the inverse styles by passing `boolean` value to it

The Ds Switch Component is a customizable UI element designed to facilitate binary toggles within an application.
It can be used to represent and manage states such as on/off, active/inactive, or any other dual-state logic.
This component is typically styled as a slider that users can interact with by clicking.

<Canvas of={DsSwitchStories.WithLabel} />

## Usage

Import `DsSwitch` in your component, and apply `ds-switch` in your component.

```ts
import { DsSwitch } from '@frontend/ui/switch'; // ðŸ‘ˆ add to file imports

@Component({
    imports: [DsSwitch], // ðŸ‘ˆ add to component imports
    template: `...`,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

There are two slots available `labelOff` and `labelOn` usually for labels, but it can be used for any other element.

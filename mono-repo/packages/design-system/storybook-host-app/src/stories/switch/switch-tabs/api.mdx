## Features

-   **Two-State Representation**: The switch component visually represents two states, commonly "on" and "off".
-   **Event Binding**: Emits events on state change, enabling the parent component or service to respond to user interactions.
-   **Data Binding**: Supports Angular's two-way data binding to keep the model and the view in sync.
-   **Disabled State**: Can be rendered in a disabled state where user interaction is prevented.

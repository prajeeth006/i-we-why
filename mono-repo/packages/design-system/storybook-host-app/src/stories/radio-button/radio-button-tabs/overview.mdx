The Ds Radio button Component is a customizable UI element. Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected..
It can be used to represent and manage states such as on/off, active/inactive, or any other dual-state logic.

A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group the same name. Once a radio group is established, selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group.

You can have as many radio groups on a page as you like, as long as each has its own unique name.

<Canvas of={DsRadioButtonStories.Default} />

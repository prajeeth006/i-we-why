## Testing

In order to easily test `DsHelpGroup` the Design System Team exports test harnesses which are utilities that query for the help group inside your application templates.

The following test harnesses are defined for DsHelpGroup:

-   DsHelpGroupHarness - a harness for retrieving `ds-help-group`
-   DsHelpItemHarness - a harness for retrieving `ds-help-item`

**DsHelpGroupHarness**:

This harness provides option to search for help groups by following options:

-   inverse
-   headerText

It provides following utilities:

-   `getHeaderText()`: to get the text of the header slot
-   `getContent()`: to get the text of the default sot
-   `getHelpItems()`: returns an array of `DsHelpItemHarness` of all child components that are of type `DsHelpItem`
-   `isInverse()`: to check if inverse is true

**DsHelpItemHarness**:

This harness provides option to search for help items by following options:

-   type
-   inputType
-   inverse
-   text

It provides following utilities:

-   `getTextContent()`: to get text of help item
-   `hasIcon()`: returns true if icon slot is provided
-   `getType()`: returns the type of the component
-   `hasType()`: check if component is of given type
-   `hasInputType()`: check if component is of given input type
-   `isInverse()`: to check if inverse is true

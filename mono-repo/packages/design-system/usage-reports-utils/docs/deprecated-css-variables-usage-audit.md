# DS Components CSS Variables Usage Audit

This audit helps you better understand what deprecated css variables are still being used, and where they are being used. 

Everytime the token extractor is run, it will also generate a file which includes all the deprecated css variables.

Using this report, you will see which one of those variables is still being used, and which ones are safe to be removed.

### This is how it looks like:
